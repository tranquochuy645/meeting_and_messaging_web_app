So, this web app is like a little playground, courtesy of the AWS free-tier magic! Feel free to click around and explore.

Just a heads up, it's a work in progress – a digital canvas for my coding adventures.

## 🚀 What's Cookin'?

This project kicked off as a learning journey. 

The dream? To see it blossom into an open-source version of something cool, maybe like a SnapChat vibe. Any contribution is appreciated!

To-do list:

- Everything else that was here before this list ✅ - Yep, that's sorted!
- Move user-uploaded stuff to AWS S3 ✅ - Done
- Polish up the app UI ❌ - Still in the design studio
- End-to-end encrypted messaging feature ❌ - Nope
- Server-side caching magic ❌ - Far away
